# my-portfolio
## Description
In this repo, I created a portfolio of work given the acceptance criteria below. While the repo is currently meant as practice, what I learned here will apply to a future portfolio version that will showcase my skills and talents to potential employers looking to fill a position in web development. I practiced to highlight my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it by creating links to the work's web application. My goal was to create a responsive web application that will nicely adjust its layout to various viewports and still be well-functioning and look aesthetically pleasing.
The portfolio includes a header with my name, a navbar linking the about, work, and contact-me sections of the page. The navbar is followed by a hero banner, which includes a picture of me and my future professional title. The work section highlights my most important work followed by other projects. Upon hover, the images enlarge and when clicked they connect to the existing web applications of mine. The links in the contact-me section lead to the responsive form of contact: phone, email, LinkedIn. 

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact the
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
